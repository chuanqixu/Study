# PennyLane Code Camp 2022

_Note: This is not the official repository for this code camp but my own repository created when I solving the challenges._

Time: 1st Nov. 2022 -- 21st Nov. 2022

In celebration of PennyLane's fourth birthday, we are taking a three-week virtual trip to the great outdoors. Test your coding skills solo or in teams during our weekly challenges. Compete for prizes, earn badges for each coding difficulty level you master, and move up the leaderboard in our first-ever PennyLane Code Camp.

# Contents

There are three levels, each of them was released per week, and each part contains 5 challenges. Generally, the difficulty increases with the level moving up, and the higher level challenge is based on the knowledge of the lower level challenge.
