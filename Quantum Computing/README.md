1. [PennyLane Code Camp 2022](pennylane-code-camp-2022/)
    * Time: 2022/11/01 - 2022/11/21
    * Introduction to [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/) usage. There are 5 problems in this code camp:
        * 1: Differentiable ZNE
        * 2: Fourier Spectrum of Quantum Models
        * 3: Gradients: A Four-Term Parameter-Shift
        * 4: Quantum Transforms and Noise
        * 5: Universality: U3 and CNOT Decomposition

2. [IBM Quantum Challenge Fall 2022](ibm-quantum-challenge-fall-22/)
    * Time: 2022/11/11 - 2022/11/18
    * Quick overview of the usage of Qiskit Runtime [Sampler](https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_runtime/stubs/qiskit_ibm_runtime.Sampler.html#sampler) and [Estimator](https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_runtime/stubs/qiskit_ibm_runtime.Estimator.html#estimator). In addition, apply them to quantum kernel learning, quantum optimization, and quantum chemistry.
