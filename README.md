### Courses

* [Berkeley CS61C: Great Ideas in Computer Architecture Fall 2020](computer-science/Berkeley-CS61C-Great-Ideas-in-Computer-Architecture/)

    Computer Organization and Architecture. The internal organization and operation of digital computers. Machine architecture, support for high-level languages (logic, arithmetic, instruction sequencing) and operating systems (I/O, interrupts, memory management, process switching). Elements of computer logic design. Tradeoffs involved in fundamental architectural design decisions. This course is based on RISC-V.

* [Stanford CS106X: Programming Abstractions (Accelerated)](computer-science/Stanford-CS106X-Programming-Abstractions-in-CPP-2019-Fall/)

    CS106X is the more advanced of two courses teaching introductory programming abstractions and algorithms. CS106X is an alternative to the more sensibly paced CS106B, because some students—self-taught programmers, exceptionally strong CS106A students, and AP Java graduates—prefer a more intense treatment in the company of other aficionados. CS106X teaches advanced abstraction techniques, worrying first about C++ language mechanics and eventually focusing on topics such as recursion, event-driven programming, C++ lists, sets, and maps, and the implementation techniques used to build custom data structures.

### Code Camps

* [PennyLane Code Camp 2022](quantum-computing/pennylane-code-camp-2022/)
    * Time: 2022/11/01 - 2022/11/21
    * Introduction to [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/) usage. There are 5 problems in this code camp:
        * 1: Differentiable ZNE
        * 2: Fourier Spectrum of Quantum Models
        * 3: Gradients: A Four-Term Parameter-Shift
        * 4: Quantum Transforms and Noise
        * 5: Universality: U3 and CNOT Decomposition

* [IBM Quantum Challenge Fall 2022](quantum-computing/ibm-quantum-challenge-fall-22/)
    * Time: 2022/11/11 - 2022/11/18
    * Quick overview of the usage of Qiskit Runtime [Sampler](https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_runtime/stubs/qiskit_ibm_runtime.Sampler.html#sampler) and [Estimator](https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_runtime/stubs/qiskit_ibm_runtime.Estimator.html#estimator). In addition, apply them to quantum kernel learning, quantum optimization, and quantum chemistry.

* [IBM Quantum Challenge Spring 2023](quantum-computing/ibm-quantum-challenge-spring-23/)
    * Time: 2023/05/17 - 2023/05/24
    * This year’s Challenge focuses on [Dynamic Circuits](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/services/programs/docs/runtime/manage/systems/dynamic-circuits/introduction), a technology that makes it easier to run more advanced quantum algorithms.
