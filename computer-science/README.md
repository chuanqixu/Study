## Courses

* [Berkeley CS61C: Great Ideas in Computer Architecture Fall 2020](Berkeley-CS61C-Great-Ideas-in-Computer-Architecture/)

    Computer Organization and Architecture. The internal organization and operation of digital computers. Machine architecture, support for high-level languages (logic, arithmetic, instruction sequencing) and operating systems (I/O, interrupts, memory management, process switching). Elements of computer logic design. Tradeoffs involved in fundamental architectural design decisions. This course is based on RISC-V.

* [Stanford CS106X: Programming Abstractions (Accelerated)](Stanford-CS106X-Programming-Abstractions-in-CPP-2019-Fall/)

    CS106X is the more advanced of two courses teaching introductory programming abstractions and algorithms. CS106X is an alternative to the more sensibly paced CS106B, because some students—self-taught programmers, exceptionally strong CS106A students, and AP Java graduates—prefer a more intense treatment in the company of other aficionados. CS106X teaches advanced abstraction techniques, worrying first about C++ language mechanics and eventually focusing on topics such as recursion, event-driven programming, C++ lists, sets, and maps, and the implementation techniques used to build custom data structures.

* [JavaScript 30](JavaScript30/)

    Beginner to Intermediate developers and designers who want to become comfortable with both JavaScript fundamentals and working in the DOM without a library. [Website](https://javascript30.com/). [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30).

* [MIT 6.1810: Operating System Engineering Fall 2023](MIT-61810-Operating-System-Engineering-2023-Fall/)

    MIT 6.1810, Operating System Engineering, is an advanced undergraduate-level course offered by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). This course provides a comprehensive exploration of the fundamental principles and techniques involved in the design, implementation, and evaluation of modern operating systems. Through a combination of lectures, programming assignments, and hands-on projects, students delve into key topics such as process management, memory management, file systems, and device drivers. By the end of the course, students gain a deep understanding of the intricate workings of operating systems and develop practical skills in system-level programming and debugging. MIT 6.S081 equips students with the knowledge and tools necessary to tackle complex operating system challenges and lays a solid foundation for further study and research in the field.
