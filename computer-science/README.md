## Courses

* [Berkeley CS61C: Great Ideas in Computer Architecture Fall 2020](Berkeley-CS61C-Great-Ideas-in-Computer-Architecture/)

    Computer Organization and Architecture. The internal organization and operation of digital computers. Machine architecture, support for high-level languages (logic, arithmetic, instruction sequencing) and operating systems (I/O, interrupts, memory management, process switching). Elements of computer logic design. Tradeoffs involved in fundamental architectural design decisions. This course is based on RISC-V.

* [Stanford CS106X: Programming Abstractions (Accelerated)](Stanford-CS106X-Programming-Abstractions-in-CPP-2019-Fall/)

    CS106X is the more advanced of two courses teaching introductory programming abstractions and algorithms. CS106X is an alternative to the more sensibly paced CS106B, because some students—self-taught programmers, exceptionally strong CS106A students, and AP Java graduates—prefer a more intense treatment in the company of other aficionados. CS106X teaches advanced abstraction techniques, worrying first about C++ language mechanics and eventually focusing on topics such as recursion, event-driven programming, C++ lists, sets, and maps, and the implementation techniques used to build custom data structures.

* [JavaScript 30](JavaScript30/)

    Beginner to Intermediate developers and designers who want to become comfortable with both JavaScript fundamentals and working in the DOM without a library. [Website](https://javascript30.com/). [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30).

* [MIT 6.1810: Operating System Engineering Fall 2023](MIT-61810-Operating-System-Engineering-2023-Fall/)

    MIT 6.1810, Operating System Engineering, is an advanced undergraduate-level course offered by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). This course provides a comprehensive exploration of the fundamental principles and techniques involved in the design, implementation, and evaluation of modern operating systems. Through a combination of lectures, programming assignments, and hands-on projects, students delve into key topics such as process management, memory management, file systems, and device drivers. By the end of the course, students gain a deep understanding of the intricate workings of operating systems and develop practical skills in system-level programming and debugging. MIT 6.S081 equips students with the knowledge and tools necessary to tackle complex operating system challenges and lays a solid foundation for further study and research in the field.

* [Stanford CS144: Introduction to Computer Networking Winter 2024](Stanford-CS144-Introduction-to-Computer-Networking-2024-Winter/)

    Stanford CS144 is an introductory course about computer networks. You will learn about the basic principles of computer networks, for example packet switching, layering, encapsulation and protocols; and you will learn how applications such as the world-wide-web, video streaming (e.g. Netflix and Hulu), video conferencing (e.g. Zoom and Skype) and BitTorrent use the network to communicate. You will spend quite a lot of time learning about the specifics of how the Internet works– which is of course by far the biggest computer network ever built. You will learn how applications communicate reliably over an unreliable Internet. And you will build portions of the Internet yourself! In fact, we believe that in CS144 you build more parts of the Internet infrastructure than in any other undergraduate networking class anywhere. It’s really fun to see how the individual pieces work: You build an Internet router, and a reliable data delivery service, and then you use it to communicate with remote servers.

* [Stanford CS231n: Deep Learning for Computer Vision Spring 2024](Stanford-CS231n-Deep-Learning-for-Computer-Vision-2024-Spring/)

    Computer Vision has become ubiquitous in our society, with applications in search, image understanding, apps, mapping, medicine, drones, and self-driving cars. Core to many of these applications are visual recognition tasks such as image classification, localization and detection. Recent developments in neural network (aka “deep learning”) approaches have greatly advanced the performance of these state-of-the-art visual recognition systems. This course is a deep dive into the details of deep learning architectures with a focus on learning end-to-end models for these tasks, particularly image classification. During the 10-week course, students will learn to implement and train their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision. Additionally, the final assignment will give them the opportunity to train and apply multi-million parameter networks on real-world vision problems of their choice. Through multiple hands-on assignments and the final course project, students will acquire the toolset for setting up deep learning tasks and practical engineering tricks for training and fine-tuning deep neural networks.
